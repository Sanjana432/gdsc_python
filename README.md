# CHIP-8 Emulator in Python

This project is a CHIP-8 emulator written in Python that can run CHIP-8 programs. The emulator includes features like:

- Fetch-decode-execute cycle
- Memory management for program instructions, registers, and stack
- Keypad input handling
- Graphical output using Pygame (64x32 pixel display)
- Save and load emulator state

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for graphical output and input handling)

To install the required libraries, run:

pip install pygame

## Features

- **Core Emulation**: Fetch, decode, and execute CHIP-8 instructions.
- **Graphics**: Display is rendered as a 64x32 pixel grid, where each pixel is a 10x10 rectangle on the screen.
- **Input**: Use the keyboard for CHIP-8 key mapping (1-4, Q-R, A-F, Z-V).
- **Timers**: Emulates the delay and sound timers.
- **Save/Load State**: Save and load the emulator's state using `pickle`.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Emulator**:
   You can run the emulator by executing the Python script `chip8_emulator.py`:

python chip8_emulator.py

2. **Load a Program**:
To load a CHIP-8 binary program, you need to use the `load_program()` method. This will load the program into memory starting at address `0x200`.

3. **Input Keys**:
The emulator uses the following key mapping for input:
- `1-4`, `q-r`, `a-f`, `z-v` correspond to the CHIP-8 keys.

4. **Saving and Loading State**:
- **Save state**: Use the `save_state(filename)` method to save the current state to a file.
- **Load state**: Use the `load_state(filename)` method to load a previously saved state.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a small example to load and run a CHIP-8 program:

```python
emulator = CHIP8()

# Load a CHIP-8 program (make sure the program is in binary format)
with open('program.ch8', 'rb') as f:
 program = f.read()
 emulator.load_program(program)

# Run the emulator
emulator.run()
